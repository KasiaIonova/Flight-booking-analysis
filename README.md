# Flight-booking-analysis

Project work on the module "SQL and Data Retrieval"

This work involved applying skills in data filtering and using aggregate functions to identify specific data characteristics. 
Window functions were utilized for data analysis in the context of grouping by various parameters. Percentages and other statistical indicators were calculated within specific data categories.
Principles of using aggregation functions and data grouping were applied to identify characteristics and trends in the information, for example, in the distribution of the number of passengers by mobile operator codes. 
Various types of joins and data filtering were applied according to task conditions. 
Different methods of data merging were used to extract necessary information and solve tasks, 
such as classifying financial turnovers by routes. Functions for rounding and calculating statistical indicators, such as the median, were used for data analysis and identifying relevant patterns.
